## File format of the Rogue Cloud `rooms.txt` file

Note:
- A "room" in the rooms.txt does not necessarily need to be a room (it is a bit of a misnomer) but rather, it corresponds to a cookie cutter structure (a grid of tiles) that can be stamped on the map at any map coordinate.
- The `rooms.txt` file is in `(path to git repository root)\RogueCloudServer\WebContent\universe\rooms.txt`

Each room in the `rooms.txt` file begins with this:
```
(Room name - this is the same as the room name in map-new-mappings.txt):
```

### Letter assignments:

Letter assignments assign letters/number/symbols (eg ASCII characters) to specific tiles on the grid. So, for example, when you see A in the grid, it means there is a corresponding letter assignment that indicates what tiles should be displayed at that location on the grid. A simple assignment like `A = 1152 Fridge`, means that whenever you see A in the grid, tile 1152 is displayed (and if the user mouses over the tile it will say Fridge).

**Letter assignments can come in different formats, listed here**:

#### 1) `* = # Name`

* *Example*: `F = 1152 Fridge`

Where:
* `*` = A single letter or symbol (example: a, b, 0, C, ., etc)
* `#` = The tile number to display at this location (eg there should exist a file #.png, where # is the number)
* `Name` = This name will be displayed when the user mouses over the tile in the game UI (but otherwise is not used)

#### 2) `* = #, %`

* *Example*: `B = 1141, 90 Table 2`

Where:
* `%` = A number indicating the number of degrees to rotate the tile when it is displayed: 0, 90, 180, 270 (0 is the default)
* `*, #, Name` = Same as above

#### 3) `* = # / # / #  Name`

* *Example*: `r = 105	/ 122	@Passable`

`#` as above, but in this case the tile will have multiple layers (separated by `/`), with the leftmost number corresponding to the image displayed on the top layer.

#### 4) `* = #, % / #, %	Name`

* *Example*: `E = 1967, 90 / 105, 180 	Fence`

You can combine tile number and rotation into a single layer, and still have multiple layers. In the above example there are two  layers: on top is tile 1967 rotated 90 degrees, and below that is tile 105 rotated 180 degrees. When this is rendered in game, the player will see exactly that.

#### 5) Annotations: `@Bg` 	`@Passable` `@Door`

`@Passable` - All tiles in a room are impassable by default; this means that monsters and creatures can't walk on them. This is true for walls and furniture, but shouldn't be true for floor tiles. For this reason, floor tiles (or other tiles that can be walked on) should be annotated with `@Passable`.

`@Door` - Add this to tiles which are doors. Doors are passable by default.

`@Bg` - Indicates that this tile replaces the background if a creature steps on it. Add this only if a tile is disappearing when a creature walks on it.

#### 6) Special letters: `*`

The `*` letter is used to set the default background for a room. If the room tile layout grid contains a space (eg " "), then it will have the background listed at the `*` character.

#### 7) Special tile numbers: `-1`

The `-1` tile number is used to indicate transparency with whatever is underneath the room (for example, grass).  

### Room tile layout grid

Each letter corresponds to a letter specified above. Each space on the grid is a tile in the world. 

Note that in most text editors, characters are taller then they are wide. So, for example, the following room looks like it is tall and thin, however in reality when displayed it will be nearly square (20x21, w x h).
