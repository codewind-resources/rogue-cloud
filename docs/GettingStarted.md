# Getting started: Playing Rogue Cloud

First, select the development environment that you want to play the game in. If you're unsure which environment to try, use **Eclipse Codewind**, a container-based microservice-oriented development environment. You can use Codewind with **Eclipse** or **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

You can also play by using a programmer's text editor, such as Atom or Sublime, or by using Eclipse and the IBM Liberty Development Tools.
