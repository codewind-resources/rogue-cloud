# Getting Started: Playing Rogue Cloud

First, select the development environment that you will be playing the game in. We highly recommend you play with **Microclimate**, which is our new container-based microservice-oriented development environment. 

You may also play using a programmer's text editor (such as VS Code or Atom), or using Eclipse and the IBM Liberty Development Tools.

### A) Install the development environment of your choice.

- *Recommended*: [Play Rogue Cloud from **Eclipse**, using **Microclimate**](Developing-Eclipse-on-Microclimate.md)
- *Recommended*: [Play Rogue Cloud from **Visual Studio Code**, using **Microclimate**](Developing-VisualStudioCode-on-Microclimate.md)
- *Recommended*: [Playing Rogue Cloud from your **Web browser**, using **Microclimate**](Developing-RogueCloud-On-Microclimate.md)

Other options:
- [Playing Rogue Cloud using a Text Editor (Sublime, VSCode) and Maven](Developing-Text-Editor.md)
- [Playing Rogue Cloud using Eclipse and IBM Liberty Developer Tools](Developing-LibertyDevTools.md)

### B) [Run the agent code, and watch it explore the game world directly from your browser.](Developing-CodingNextSteps.md)
