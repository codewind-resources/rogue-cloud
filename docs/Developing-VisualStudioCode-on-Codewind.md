- If you already have Visual Studio Code installed, skip to the next section.

1) Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and select your operating system.
2) After the download completes, run the installer (Windows) or install the package (Linux/MacOS).
3) After the install is completed, run Visual Studio code.

### B) Installing Codewind Tools into Visual Studio Code

1) In Visual Studio Code, select `View` (menu bar item) > `Extensions`. Under `Search Extensions in Marketplace`, enter `Microclimate`.
2) Select `Codewind`, and click the `Install` button on the right-hand screen.

3) If you are asked to restart Visual Studio Code, do so. Otherwise proceed to the next step.

4) You will now be presented with a dialog: `"Codewind requires the installation of Docker container to run, which might take a few minutes to download. Do you want to complete the installation now?"`. Click `Install`.

5)  You should see a status message `Pulling Codewind Docker images` on the bottom right hand corner of the screen. Wait for this to complete. After the images are downloaded, you should see `Starting Codewind`, then `Codewind installation is complete`. Click OK.
