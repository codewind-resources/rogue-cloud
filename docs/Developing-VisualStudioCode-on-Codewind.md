## Play Rogue Cloud using Codewind Visual Studio Code Tools

### A) Install Visual Studio Code
- If you already have Visual Studio Code installed, skip to the next section.

1) Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and select your operating system.
2) After the download completes, run the installer (Windows) or install the package (Linux/MacOS).
3) After the install is completed, run Visual Studio code.

For Visual Studio Code, we recommend the 'Java Extension Pack', which includes tighter integration with the Java platform.
 
### B) Install the Codewind prerequisities: Docker, Docker Compose, and Git

Installation prerequisites:
- *On Mac*: Install 'Docker Desktop for Mac' and Git (on this platform Docker Compose is bundled with Docker Desktop)
- *On Windows*: Install 'Docker Desktop for Windows' and Git (on this platform Docker Compose is bundled with Docker Desktop)
- *On Linux*: Install Docker, Docker Compose, and Git (on this platform, unlike Mac/Windows, Docker Compose *must* be downloaded separately)

Additional configuration steps for these platforms may be required. See the [Codewind local install documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/installlocally.html) for full details.

### C) Installing Codewind Tools into Visual Studio Code

1) In Visual Studio Code, select `View` (menu bar) > `Extensions`. Under `Search Extensions in Marketplace`, enter `Codewind`.
2) Select `Codewind`, and click the `Install` button on the right panel.

3) If you are asked to restart Visual Studio Code, do so. Otherwise proceed to the next step.

4) You will now be presented with a dialog: `"Codewind requires the installation of Docker containers to run, which might take a few minutes to download. Do you want to complete the installation now?"`. Click `Install`.

5)  You should see a status message `Pulling Codewind Docker images` on the bottom-right corner of the screen. Wait for this to complete. After the images are downloaded, you should see `Starting Codewind`, then `Codewind installation is complete`. Click `OK`.

6) Select `View` (menu bar) > `Explorer`. On the bottom-left corner of Explorer, you should now see a 'Codewind' view. Expand this panel if it is not already expanded.

More information on [installing Codewind into Visual Studio Code](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdt-vsc-getting-started.html) is available from our website.

### D) Git clone the Rogue Cloud client into Codewind workspace directory.

Codewind creates a folder called `codewind-workspace` within your home directory to contain your projects. In this step we will locate that folder, and then `git clone` the Rogue Cloud client into that folder.

1) Determine the location of the Codewind workspace directory:
- *Mac/Linux*: `docker inspect codewind-pfe | grep "HOST_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY="`
  - Example: `"HOST_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY=/home/user/codewind/codewind-workspace"` means your workspace can be found in `/home/user/codewind/codewind-workspace`
- *Windows*: `docker inspect codewind-pfe | find "HOST_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY="`
  - Example: `"HOST_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY=C:\\codewind-workspace"` means the Codewind workspace is `c:\codewind-workspace`
2) From within the `codewind-workspace` directory, clone the Rogue Cloud client repo.
  ```
  cd (path to your codewind workspace from the previous step)
  git clone https://github.com/microclimate-dev2ops/rogue-cloud-client-codewind
  ```
3) Back in Visual Studio Code, under the `Codewind` view, right-click on `Projects (Local)` and select `Add Existing Project`. Specify the path of the `rogue-cloud-client-codewind` folder that you cloned from the previous step, then click `Add to Codewind`.
4) You will see a brief `Processing...` status message, followed by a `Please confirm the project type` message.
- The Type field should be: `liberty`
- The Language field should be: `Java`
- If one or both of these are inaccurate, jump back to step 3 and ensure the correct path is selected.
5) Presuming your project is correctly identified, click `Yes`. 
6) Before the code starts building, the container needs to initialize and download the Java and Maven dependencies for the underlying build system. This can take between 5 to 10 minutes depending on CPU and network connection (this initialization is only required the first time you use the Codewind tools).

### E) Register a user and then make changes to the SimpleAI class

1) In the code editor, press ``CTRL-P`` (``Command-P`` on Mac) and type ``StartAgentServlet.java``, and select ``StartAgentServlet.java``.
* ``CTRL-P/Command-P`` is a great way to quickly find Java classes in Visual Studio Code.

2) Edit the following fields in `StartAgentServlet.java` to create a new user and password.
```
public static final String USERNAME = "(specify a username here!)";
public static final String PASSWORD = "(specify a password here!)";
```
* These values are to ensure that *only you* can access and control your character.
* The username and password you specify are automatically registered when your code first begins controlling a character on the game map, and they do not have to correspond to an existing email address or account.

3) Press ``CTRL-S`` (``Command-S`` on Mac) in order to save your changes.

4) Press ``CTRL-P`` (``Command-P`` on Mac) and type ``SimpleAI.java`` and select ``SimpleAI.java``.

5) This class is the main AI class. Changes made to this class are reflected in your AI running on the Liberty Server.


### F) Next steps: watch your agent go, and start coding

To watch your agent as it interacts with the game world, right-click on the `gameclient` project in the `Codewind` view and select `Open in Browser`.

This will open a browser to the root of your application.

Congratulations, your character is now exploring and interacting with the game world, and earning you points on the leaderboard!
