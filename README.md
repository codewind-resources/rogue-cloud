## Introduction

Rogue Cloud is an open-world top-down 2D multiplayer game, but unlike a traditional game where you control it with a controller, keyboard, or mouse, with Rogue Cloud you are actually writing code to control your character as it interacts with a vast, dangerous game world. Behind the scenes the code that you write is packaged into a WebSocket-based microservice, which like a traditional microservice, provides or supports a variety of cloud-native requirements.
