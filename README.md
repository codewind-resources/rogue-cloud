## Introduction

Rogue Cloud is an open-world top-down 2D multiplayer game, but unlike a traditional game where you control it with a controller/keyboard/mouse, with Rogue Cloud you are actually writing code to control your character as it interacts with vast, dangerous game world. Behind the scenes the code that you write is packaged into a websocket-based microservice, which like a traditional microservice, provides or supports a variety of cloud-native requirements.

## <a name="tech"></a> The Technology Behind the Game

Rogue Cloud is built on **Open Liberty**, the premier platform for building Java cloud-native applications and microservices. 
  * Learn more about our latest and greatest [open source enterprise application server](https://openliberty.io/). 

Building microservices and cloud-native applications requires tools that lets developers rapidly develop and deploy applications to the cloud.
  * Learn more about **Microclimate**, our [container-based development tools driving end-to-end delivery and rapid iteration of Node/Java/Swift application development](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/).
	
Rogue Cloud is designed to showcase the capabilities of our Kubernetes-based **IBM Cloud Private** and **IBM Cloud Containers** services. 
  * Learn about deploying your containers to Kubernetes using the [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/) and the [IBM Cloud Containers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service) services.
