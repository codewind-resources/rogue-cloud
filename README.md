## Introduction

Rogue Cloud is an open-world top-down 2D multiplayer game, but unlike a traditional game where you control it with a controller, keyboard, or mouse, with Rogue Cloud you are actually writing code to control your character as it interacts with a vast, dangerous game world. Behind the scenes the code that you write is packaged into a WebSocket-based microservice, which like a traditional microservice, provides or supports a variety of cloud-native requirements.

## <a name="tech"></a> The Technology Behind the Game

Building microservices and cloud-native applications requires tools that lets developers rapidly develop and deploy applications to the cloud.
  * Learn more about **Microclimate**, our [container-based development tools driving end-to-end delivery and rapid iteration of Node/Java/Swift/Go/Python/Docker application development](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/).

Rogue Cloud is built on **Open Liberty**, the premier platform for building Java cloud-native applications and microservices.
  * Learn more about our latest and greatest [open source enterprise application server](https://openliberty.io/).

Rogue Cloud is designed to showcase the capabilities of our Kubernetes-based **IBM Cloud Private** and the public **IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service** services.
  * Learn more about deploying your containers to Kubernetes using the [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/) and the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service) services.
